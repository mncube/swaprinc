## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed unnecessary spaces in the DESCRIPTION file

* added () behind all function names in the description texts (i.e., swaprinc()
  and compswap())
  
* Commented out '(see swaprinc documentation)' for the swaprinc_loud() function 
  to make sure all code is executable.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* New submission
